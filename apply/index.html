        The Shuttleworth Foundation offers fellowships to individuals
        to implement their innovative idea for social change. We are
        most interested in exceptional ideas at the intersection
        between technology, knowledge and learning, with openness
        being the key requirement.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Foundation funds people from all over the world regardless
        of gender, age, nationality or experience. We are looking for
        a complete picture of you and your idea.

	We invite individuals with a fresh approach to solving a
	social challenge, using openness, to apply to our Fellowship
	Program.

      <p>
	Applicants may choose to make their application public at any
        time. You are most welcome to do so. For those who choose not
        to, your application will remain private in its entirety
        within the Foundation and its immediate support network until
        such time as you may be offered a Fellowship. At that point,
        we will have a conversation on how best to share information
        about you as a Fellow in the interest of openness. Applicants
        who choose to make their application public do not have a
        specific advantage over those who choose not to do so during
        the selection process.
      </p>

	In order to keep your application private, you may choose to
	protect your video submission with a password. Please submit
	the password along with the video link via our secure
	application form.

	No partial applications will be considered.

	Over the years we have reviewed (and funded) many, many
        proposals and fellowship applications. In the current
        incarnation of the Foundation we support individuals to
        implement their idea for social change. Prospective applicants
        often ask us to narrow down the parameters for applications
        and be more specific about what weâ€™re looking for. We are not
        planning on doing that, as we want to be surprised and
        intrigued by applicants, no matter how unconventional the idea
        may be.
      </p>
      <p>
	However, we can provide some thoughts on what to keep in mind
	while developing your application for our fellowship. We hope
	these are useful, for applying for the Fellowship, and for
	distilling the essence of your idea.
      </p>
      <p>
	Our number one ask is that openness be at the core of your
	idea and/or its implementation. Openness is not an add on. It
	is a&nbsp; fundamental approach to both participation and
	intellectual property...
